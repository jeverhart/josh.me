		    				<h3>Introduction</h3>
		    				<p><a href="https://betterview.net">Betterview</a> is a fast-growing San Francisco startup that uses drones, AI, and their insurance industry experience to analyze risk. As a part of the team at <a href="http:/elevate.co">Elevate</a>, we were called on to define their brand and deliver product & pitch deck design along with a new website. The majority of my time on this project was spent building & delivering the website, but I was also involved throughout the brand, logo, and design process.</p>

		    				<h3>Front-End Development</h3>
		    				<h2>Layout builds & Responsive design</h2>
		    				<p>As defined in the information architecture, I built 10 front-end layouts using HTML/CSS/JS with reusable components to be integrated with WordPress on the back-end. I also adapted the designs to be responsive across all screen sizes and designed the Events & Press page layouts as those had not yet been defined during the design phase.</p>

		    			</div>
		    			<div class="grid-entry text">
		    				<p>The team layout uses connecting lines throughout the page to give the page some hierarchy while still connecting all of the team members to a final CTA to the careers page. It automatically adapts to different screen sizes and also to adding new team members within WordPress.</p>

		    			</div>
		    			<div class="grid-entry text">
		    				<h2>Motion & Animation</h2>
		    				<p>The home page uses a touch of parallax & a fade-in animation to add some feeling to the hero section, while the platform page introduces a video animation of their commercial & residential offerings. Custom timeline reveal & button hover animations have been added throughout for a finishing touch.</p>

		    				<h2>Custom Functionality</h2>
		    				<p>To provide users with some initial ROI information and generate leads, I built an ROI calculator that uses javascript to make the calculations, and integrates with Ninja Forms on the back-end to send the lead information to the appropriate Betterview team members.</p>

		    				<p>The event entries in WordPress allow for a custom field to specify what the company’s involvement in the event will be. I designed the page & created a basic filter mechanism to allow for easy sorting of the events on the front-end.</p>

		    				<h3>Back-End Development</h3>
		    				<h2>WordPress Integration</h2>
		    				<p>Keeping a WordPress installation as lightweight as possible is always one of my primary goals for any website. In my experience, this is best for performance, and makes for the most future-proof solution by minimizing the reliance on third-party software.</p>
		    				<p>Using the default content editor, featured images, and Advanced Custom Fields, each layout type is separated into modules to allow for easy editing by the client. This gives them the flexibility to edit any piece of content they need without worrying about disrupting the design system.</p>

		    			</div>
		    			<div class="grid-entry text">
		    				<p>Custom post types were created within the theme specifically for Solutions, Events & Press entries. This allows these content types to be used throughout the site & called upon for whichever page needs to display them. It also keeps the posts, pages, and other areas of the WordPress admin from becoming cluttered with entries that wouldn’t naturally be grouped together.</p>

		    			</div>
		    			<div class="grid-entry text">
		    				<p>Ninja Forms is a WordPress plugin that the client had already been using in previous site versions, and I integrated it throughout the new site design & with zapier to power the necessary forms while also holding on to their existing data.</p>
		    				<p>The client’s hosting choice for this project was <a href="https://wpengine.com">WP Engine</a>, which provides a great managed solution, with caching, regular backups, and a staging area that we used while preparing the new site.</p>

		    				<h3>Brand</h3>
		    				<h2>Ideation & Process</h2>
		    				<p>The Betterview website has seen several iterations throughout the years. In 2017, a company re-brand was set in motion to eventually produce the website that was built above. I participated in a Brand Workshop to help define the future of the company and to put in place a foundation for the future. Being involved in this process, and also participating in the creation of the logo mark provided me valuable insight for the remainder of the project. Below you can see some initial sketches that ended up heavily contributing conceptually to the final mark.</p>
